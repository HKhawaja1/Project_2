### Development Process

#### Planning and Design

- Structured the HTML to create a semantic and organised layout.
- Used appropriate semantic HTML tags for footer, navigation, sections, etc.

#### CSS Styling

## Challenges Faced

- **Responsive Design:** Ensuring the website looks good and functions well on different devices requires careful planning and multiple iterations.
- **Carousel Functionality:** Implementing the scrolling functionality for the product categories carousel was challenging, particularly handling edge cases and ensuring smooth transitions.
- **Interactivity with JavaScript:** Encountered a lot of errors with the shopping form as it kept breaking down whenever more code was added so this was kept as simple as possible.
